      <description>There are a plenty of tutorials and guides on gathering data from REST APIs using Python, especially for data scientists; the aim of this tutorial is to present some ideas, components, and recipes which tackle issues a data scientist may encounter extending their code to run in a more robust setting. Using these techniques, data science code can be a little closer to data engineering.
Techniques aside, using APIs usually involves navigating incoherent documentation, a small myriad of standards (most of which aren&amp;rsquo;t followed), and often struggling with existing SDKs - the advantage of HTTP based APIs is it is easy to write your own code to pull in the data, and with the right Python practices easy to solidify it.</description>

      <title>Exploring Redis streams with Akka streams</title>

      <description>Redis is an in-memory database and Akka streams is a popular reactive streams implementation for Scala. In this post we explore a simple end-to-end toy example to demonstrate using Redis streams in Akka streams via the popular Java library Lettuce. The repo vlukiyanov/akka-redis-streams-example contains the complete code for the examples below.
The Redis streams data structure implements a persistent log with support for consumer groups, and is designed to fan out messages to multiple consumers.</description>
